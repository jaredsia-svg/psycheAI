# 💞 Kindred

Upload your Instagram data export. Kindred unpacks it in your browser, distils it into an evidence
summary, and hands that to a language model — **Google Gemini** or **Anthropic Claude** — which
writes you a detailed profile: your Big Five and MBTI with the reasoning behind each, your interests,
beliefs and values, and your strengths and weaknesses — both in relationships and in your career.

That profile is tagged to a **QR code**. Scan someone else's and the model assesses how the two of
you would work together, scoring **romantic** and **platonic** compatibility separately and writing a
playbook aimed at each of you about the other.

## Running it

Kindred needs a server because an API key cannot ship inside a web page. Set whichever key you have:

```bash
npm install

# Google Gemini — get a key at aistudio.google.com/apikey
export GEMINI_API_KEY=...
npm start                 # http://localhost:3000

# …or Anthropic Claude
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
npm start
```

Or click through the whole app with canned analyses and no API calls:

```bash
npm run mock              # http://localhost:3000, KINDRED_MOCK=1
```

Camera scanning needs HTTPS or `localhost`; pasting a link and uploading a photo of a code always
work.

### Choosing a provider and model

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Uses Gemini. Takes priority if both keys are set. |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Uses Claude. |
| `KINDRED_PROVIDER` | Forces `gemini` or `anthropic` when you have both keys. |
| `GEMINI_MODEL` | Gemini model ID. Default `gemini-3.6-flash`. |
| `KINDRED_MODEL` | Claude model ID. Default `claude-opus-5`. |
| `KINDRED_MOCK=1` | Canned analyses, no API calls. Beats everything else. |

Gemini model IDs change often, so the default here will go stale. List what your key can actually
reach:

```bash
npm run models            # needs GEMINI_API_KEY
```

`gemini-3.6-flash` is the default because it is generally available and cheap enough to re-run
freely. For a deeper read try `GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-3.1-pro-preview`, which is stronger at reasoning
but preview-only.

Both providers share the same prompts and the same output schemas (`lib/prompts.js`) — Gemini's
`responseJsonSchema` accepts real JSON Schema, so nothing is translated between them. The server
picks a provider at startup and the rest of the app never knows which one ran.

## What is sent where

This is the part worth reading carefully.

| Stays on your device | Sent to the model |
|---|---|
| The `.zip` archive itself | An **evidence digest**: activity counts, hour-of-day and day-of-week histograms, posting regularity, a sample of your own captions and comments, accounts you follow, and the topics Instagram itself inferred about you |
| Your photos and videos — never opened | |
| Your full long-form report | The compact **card** — the same profile as short phrases — when someone runs a comparison |
| Direct messages, unless you opt in | If you opt in: DM counts plus a sample of **your own** messages only |

### What is complete and what is sampled

The distinction matters more than the digest's size. **Complete** — every count, the full
hour-of-day and day-of-week histograms computed over every timestamped event, month-by-month
activity across your whole account history, posting regularity, and Instagram's own inferred
topics. **Sampled** — the text:

| Source | Cap |
|---|---|
| Captions | 560 |
| Comments you wrote | 360 |
| Accounts you follow | 1,000, spread evenly across the list rather than taken from the head |
| Accounts you like / save most | 240 / 120 |
| Your own DMs (opt-in only) | 280 |

A small account sends about 6KB; a heavy one with thousands of posts lands around **150KB**, well
inside the 600KB ceiling and a small fraction of either provider's 1M-token context. The digest
carries a `coverage.sampling` field saying what fraction of each source the model is seeing, and the
prompt tells it to factor that into its confidence score rather than treating the sample as the
whole picture.

Images are never analysed — for a heavily visual account with few captions, that is a real blind
spot.

The archive is unzipped in the browser with the File API. The server proxies two model calls and
stores nothing — your profile and reports live in this browser's local storage until you press
delete. Whichever provider you configure receives the digest, so pick the one whose data-handling
terms you are happy with.

## How the analysis works

`lib/prompts.js` holds both prompts and both output schemas. The model is asked to weigh the
evidence honestly:

- **Their own words** — captions, comments, bio — are the strongest signal.
- **Instagram's inferred topics** are real signal about attention, but noisy.
- **Accounts followed** mix interest, aspiration and social circle.
- **Behavioural rhythm** — when and how regularly they post, how much they engage outward — is
  genuine trait evidence and usually overlooked.
- **Absence is weak evidence.** Most people are near the middle on most traits.

Both calls use **structured outputs**, so the response is guaranteed to match the schema and the UI
renders it without defensive parsing. Both stream, because thinking tokens and a long report share
one output budget.

### What the model is told not to do

Identify or speculate about specific other people in your data, or infer sexual orientation, health
conditions, immigration status or political affiliation unless you have stated it outright in your
own words. It does not classify anyone by appearance or by the demographics of who they follow.
These guardrails are asserted by the test suite so they survive edits to the prompt.

## The QR code

Along with the long-form report the model produces a compact **card** — the profile reduced to short
labelled phrases. `docs/card.js` trims it to hard limits, deflate-compresses it and base64url-encodes
it, which gets a rich profile down to **roughly 600–900 characters**: dense, but scannable off a
phone screen. There is nothing to look up and no account to create.

The card is also exactly what the compatibility call receives, so whatever is trimmed is invisible to
the other person's report — and your long-form report never leaves your device.

## Compatibility

Romantic and platonic fit are scored separately because they are different questions. Romance turns
on life direction, values, emotional safety and whether two daily rhythms can coexist; friendship
turns on shared interests, compatible energy and low friction. A pair can be a great friendship and a
poor romance, and the report says so when that is the case.

Each mode gets a score, an honest verdict, what works, what will rub, and a playbook addressed to
each person individually about the other.

## Tests

```bash
npm test           # 94 checks: synthesises a real ZIP export and runs
                   # unzip → parse → digest → card → QR → decode; proves the
                   # digest caps and budget hold on a heavy account; validates
                   # both prompt schemas against the structured-output rules and
                   # the keyword subset Gemini supports; and exercises every
                   # branch of provider selection
npm run test:ui    # 39 checks: drives the real UI in Chromium against a
                   # mock-mode server, upload through to a compatibility report
npm run test:live  # 15 checks: two real model calls against whichever provider
                   # is configured. Skips cleanly without a key.
```

`test:ui` needs Playwright (installed by `npm install`); add `--shots` to write screenshots to
`tools/screenshots/`.

Only `test:live` exercises the actual model call — everything else runs against `lib/mock.js`, which
returns schema-shaped canned data so the rest of the pipeline can be tested without tokens. Run
`test:live` once against your own key before trusting the app end to end.

## What this is not

Not a validated psychometric instrument, not a diagnosis, not a background check. A language model
reading behavioural traces is a mirror and a conversation starter. A low compatibility score is a
list of things worth talking about, not a reason to walk away — and a high one is not a promise.
