# 🧠 PsycheAI

*The personality analysis you didn't know you needed.*

Upload your Instagram data export. PsycheAI unpacks it in your browser, distils it into an evidence
summary, and hands that to a language model — **Google Gemini** or **Anthropic Claude** — which
writes you a detailed profile: your Big Five and a long-form MBTI reading with the reasoning behind
each, a behavioural read of how you actually use Instagram, your interests, beliefs and values, and
your strengths and weaknesses — both in relationships and in your career. Export the whole thing to
PDF when you are done.

That profile is tagged to a **QR code**. Scan someone else's and the model assesses how the two of
you would work together, scoring **romantic** and **platonic** compatibility separately and writing a
playbook aimed at each of you about the other.

## Running it

PsycheAI needs a server because an API key cannot ship inside a web page. Set whichever key you have:

```bash
npm install

# Google Gemini — get a key at aistudio.google.com/apikey
export GEMINI_API_KEY=...
npm start                 # http://localhost:3000

# …or Anthropic Claude
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
npm start
```

Or click through the whole app with canned analyses and no API calls:

```bash
npm run mock              # http://localhost:3000, PSYCHEAI_MOCK=1
```

Camera scanning needs HTTPS or `localhost`; pasting a link and uploading a photo of a code always
work.

### Choosing a provider and model

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Uses Gemini. Takes priority if both keys are set. |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Uses Claude. |
| `PSYCHEAI_PROVIDER` | Forces `gemini` or `anthropic` when you have both keys. |
| `GEMINI_MODEL` | Gemini model ID. Default `gemini-3.6-flash`. |
| `PSYCHEAI_MODEL` | Claude model ID. Default `claude-opus-5`. |
| `PSYCHEAI_MOCK=1` | Canned analyses, no API calls. Beats everything else. |

Gemini model IDs change often, so the default here will go stale. List what your key can actually
reach:

```bash
npm run models            # needs GEMINI_API_KEY
```

`gemini-3.6-flash` is the default because it is generally available and cheap enough to re-run
freely. For a deeper read try `GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-3.1-pro-preview`, which is stronger at reasoning
but preview-only.

Both providers share the same prompts and the same output schemas (`lib/prompts.js`) — Gemini's
`responseJsonSchema` accepts real JSON Schema, so nothing is translated between them. The server
picks a provider at startup and the rest of the app never knows which one ran.

## What is sent where

This is the part worth reading carefully.

| Stays on your device | Sent to the model |
|---|---|
| The `.zip` archive itself | An **evidence digest**: activity counts, hour-of-day and day-of-week histograms, posting regularity, a sample of your own captions and comments, accounts you follow, and the topics Instagram itself inferred about you |
| Every video — never opened | By default: about **14 of your own photographs**, downscaled, spread across your whole account history |
| Your full long-form report | The compact **card** — the same profile as short phrases — when someone runs a comparison |
| Direct messages, if you untick the box | By default: DM counts plus a sample of **your own** messages — never the other side of a conversation |

### What is complete and what is sampled

The distinction matters more than the digest's size. **Complete** — every count, the full
hour-of-day and day-of-week histograms computed over every timestamped event, month-by-month
activity across your whole account history, posting regularity, and Instagram's own inferred
topics. **Sampled** — the text:

| Source | Cap |
|---|---|
| Captions | 560 |
| Comments you wrote | 360 |
| Accounts you follow | 1,000, spread evenly across the list rather than taken from the head |
| Accounts you like / save most | 240 / 120 |
| Your own DMs | 280 — included by default, untick the box before uploading to exclude them |

A small account sends about 6KB; a heavy one with thousands of posts lands around **150KB**, well
inside the 600KB ceiling and a small fraction of either provider's 1M-token context. The digest
carries a `coverage.sampling` field saying what fraction of each source the model is seeing, and the
prompt tells it to factor that into its confidence score rather than treating the sample as the
whole picture.

### The photographs

Text alone leaves a real blind spot: a wordless photo of a summit and a wordless photo of a
nightclub are the same row in the digest. So **a small sample of images is sent by default**, and
the switch on the upload page turns it off.

`docs/images.js` picks them. Candidates are the stills the JSON references — carousels contribute
only their cover frame, videos never qualify, and anything under 12KB is discarded as a thumbnail
or a screenshot of text. Each is scored: posts outrank stories, **wordless posts get a bonus**
because they are precisely what the digest cannot see, and larger files break ties. Then the
timeline is cut into as many buckets as there are slots and the best of each bucket is taken, with
no two picks from the same day — so the result spans first post to last rather than fifteen photos
from one good summer.

The chosen images are decoded, downscaled to a 768px long edge and re-encoded as JPEG **in the
browser**, which also strips whatever EXIF the originals carried, GPS included. About 14 images
land near 1MB of base64 and add roughly $0.01 to a Gemini Flash run.

The prompt's limits on them are stricter than anything else in the app, and the test suite pins
each one: nothing about any other person in the frame, nothing about anyone's race, body, age,
attractiveness or wealth, no reading a location closely enough to place someone, and no quoting
text out of a photo. What the model may use is the setting, the activity, whether someone is alone
or in company, and the care taken over the shot.

The images are held in memory only. They are never written to localStorage, so re-running the
analysis after a page reload uses the written evidence alone unless you upload the `.zip` again.

**Direct messages are included by default**, because how someone writes to people who already know
them is the most revealing text in the export. Only the user's own messages are ever sampled — the
other side of every conversation is counted for the statistics and then discarded, before anything
leaves the browser. The switch on the upload page turns the whole thing off.

The archive is unzipped in the browser with the File API. The server proxies two model calls and
stores nothing — your profile and reports live in this browser's local storage until you press
delete. Whichever provider you configure receives the digest, so pick the one whose data-handling
terms you are happy with.

## How the analysis works

`lib/prompts.js` holds both prompts and both output schemas. The model is asked to weigh the
evidence honestly:

- **Their own words** — captions, comments, bio — are the strongest signal.
- **Instagram's inferred topics** are real signal about attention, but noisy.
- **Accounts followed** mix interest, aspiration and social circle.
- **Behavioural rhythm** — when and how regularly they post, how much they engage outward — is
  genuine trait evidence and usually overlooked.
- **Their photographs** show what captions leave out — setting, activity, alone or in company —
  but are the weakest evidence per item and the easiest to over-read.
- **Absence is weak evidence.** Most people are near the middle on most traits.

Both calls use **structured outputs**, so the response is guaranteed to match the schema and the UI
renders it without defensive parsing. Both stream, because thinking tokens and a long report share
one output budget.

### What the model is told not to do

Identify or speculate about specific other people in your data, or infer sexual orientation, health
conditions, immigration status or political affiliation unless you have stated it outright in your
own words. It does not classify anyone by appearance or by the demographics of who they follow, and
the photographs carry the further limits described above. These guardrails are asserted by the test
suite so they survive edits to the prompt.

## What the report contains

It opens on **one noun** — an animal, a material, a place, a trade, with an emoji and the reasoning
for why that one and not a neighbouring one. The prompt asks for something concrete and slightly
surprising, and explicitly rejects a compliment in a costume ("Diamond", "Star") or a restatement of
a hobby. Because a model told to send exactly one emoji will occasionally send a sentence, the
client checks the glyph and substitutes a placeholder rather than printing prose where the icon goes.

Then Big Five with per-trait evidence; interests, beliefs and values; relationship and career
strengths and weaknesses — the **attachment** guess shows its working, naming the behavioural traces
it rests on, the style it rejected, and what it means in practice for them and for a partner, since
a named style with no reasoning is worthless and slightly harmful. And two longer sections:

**MBTI**, written to be worth reading rather than worth skimming. The type and its nickname, then
per axis how strongly the data leans (`slight` / `moderate` / `clear`) and what that letter looks
like in their ordinary week — followed by a portrait in their own second person covering where the
type serves them, where it costs them and how they get misread. The prompt is explicit that a
sentence which would survive being pasted into a stranger's profile must be rewritten or cut, that
the portrait should sting slightly somewhere, and that a hedged letter beats a confident wrong one.

**Instagram behaviour**, which is the part of the export nobody reads themselves: what they post and
in what mix, when they reach for the app, how their use changed month by month, whether they publish
more than they read, and what the shape of their following and liking says about where attention
goes. Each implication pairs one concrete observation with one hedged inference, so the reader can
tell a fact from a guess.

## Exporting to PDF

Buttons at the top and bottom of the profile call `window.print()`, and `@media print` in
`styles.css` *is* the PDF: navigation and buttons drop out, cards become page-break units, colour
goes to black-on-white and the QR shrinks to a paper-appropriate 180px.

This is deliberately not a bundled PDF library. A dozen pages of long-form text is exactly what
print CSS is for — the text stays selectable and searchable, pagination and paper size are the
browser's problem, and it adds nothing to the page weight. `html2canvas` and friends would rasterise
the same report into a fuzzy image and cost 200KB. The trade is that the user picks *Save as PDF* in
their own print dialog rather than getting an automatic download; the page says so under the button.

The UI suite asserts the print rules under `emulateMedia({ media: 'print' })` rather than trusting
that they exist.

## The QR code

Along with the long-form report the model produces a compact **card** — the profile reduced to short
labelled phrases. `docs/card.js` trims it to hard limits, deflate-compresses it and base64url-encodes
it, which gets a rich profile down to **roughly 600–900 characters**: dense, but scannable off a
phone screen. There is nothing to look up and no account to create.

The card is also exactly what the compatibility call receives, so whatever is trimmed is invisible to
the other person's report — and your long-form report never leaves your device.

## Compatibility

Romantic and platonic fit are scored separately because they are different questions. Romance turns
on life direction, values, emotional safety and whether two daily rhythms can coexist; friendship
turns on shared interests, compatible energy and low friction. A pair can be a great friendship and a
poor romance, and the report says so when that is the case.

Each mode gets a score, an honest verdict, what works, what will rub, and a playbook addressed to
each person individually about the other.

## Tests

```bash
npm test           # 165 checks: synthesises a real ZIP export and runs
                   # unzip → parse → digest → card → QR → decode; proves the
                   # digest caps and budget hold on a heavy account; checks the
                   # image selector spans the timeline and drops what it should;
                   # validates both prompt schemas against the structured-output
                   # rules and the keyword subset Gemini supports; and exercises
                   # every branch of provider selection
npm run test:ui    # 125 checks: drives the real UI in Chromium against a
                   # mock-mode server, upload through to a compatibility report.
                   # Decodes and re-encodes the fixture's real PNGs, and asserts
                   # against the actual request body that the images sent are
                   # JPEGs, are not the originals, and vanish on opt-out
npm run test:live  # 15 checks: two real model calls against whichever provider
                   # is configured. Skips cleanly without a key.
```

`test:ui` needs Playwright (installed by `npm install`); add `--shots` to write screenshots to
`tools/screenshots/`.

Only `test:live` exercises the actual model call — everything else runs against `lib/mock.js`, which
returns schema-shaped canned data so the rest of the pipeline can be tested without tokens. Run
`test:live` once against your own key before trusting the app end to end.

## What this is not

Not a validated psychometric instrument, not a diagnosis, not a background check. A language model
reading behavioural traces is a mirror and a conversation starter. A low compatibility score is a
list of things worth talking about, not a reason to walk away — and a high one is not a promise.
